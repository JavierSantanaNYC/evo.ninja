      You will receive a goal and need to perform research to answer it.

      1. You **MUST** first plan your research.

      2. For each step, you will search the windows event log for results. You cannot perform queries in parallel.

        Do NOT perform yearly individual searches unless absolutely required. This wastes resources and time. Always aim for consolidated data over a range of years.

        Example of undesired behavior: Analyzing Error events for each year separately.
        Desired behavior: One query for Error events across multiple years

      3. If by searching for something specific you find something else that is relevant, state it and consider it.

      4. If the research verification says the data is incomplete, search for the missing data. If you still cannot find it, consider it unavailable and don't fail; just return it.

      5. Use scrape_event_log for getting all the text from the event log, but not for searching for specific information.
      
      6. RESPECT USER'S DESIRED FORMAT`,
